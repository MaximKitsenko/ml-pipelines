# STUDY

List of self-study materials to understand the context of the project
and possible applications.


## 1. Intro

The MLP project was born out of hobby project related to replicating a
high precision robotics arm. At this project it was frustrating to
manage a small collection of sensor data coming from various experiments.


At the same time we've experienced frustration with managing 2.0 TB
data lake in production (and were not able to find a tool to help
us). There was a desire to have something pain-free at least for the
internal purposes.

For the historical context, read through these blog posts:

2. [Dive into FPGA](https://abdullin.com/dive-into-fpga/)
3. [Running on a real FPGA](https://abdullin.com/running-on-a-real-fpga/)

At the same time two resources helped to shape the original vision of
the problem and potential solutions:

- _Zhamak Dehghani_ published an article on [How to Move Beyond a
  Monolithic Data Lake to a Distributed
  Data Mesh](https://martinfowler.com/articles/data-monolith-to-mesh.html)
- _Stephen Pimentel_ gave a 5 minute talk on [machine learning pipelines at Apple](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=16uU_Aaxp9Y).

For understanding the scope of the problem space, read through the
article and watch the talk.
